### 20H/501Y.V2
Also known as `B.1.351`
Announced in December 2020, 501Y.V2 originated and/or initially expanded in South Africa ([Tegally et al., medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.21.20248640v1)).

501Y.V2 is associated with multiple mutations in Spike, including: <AaMut mut={'S:N501Y'}/>, <Link href="/variants/S.E484"> <AaMut mut={'S:E484K'}/></Link> (<Link href="/variants/S.E484">see <Var name="S:E484"/> page</Link>), <AaMut mut={'S:K417N'}/>, and <AaMut mut={'S:D80A'}/>.
Additionally, there is a deletion at 242-245.<br/>
There is also a mutation in Nucleocapsid: <AaMut mut={'N:T205I'}/> and a deletion in <code>ORF1a</code>(<code>Nsp6</code>) at positions 3675-3677 (also seen in 501Y.V1 and 501Y.V3).
It does _not_ have the deletion at 69/70.

- Sera from individuals vaccined with the Moderna vaccine showed no significant reduction of neutralization against 501Y.V1 and a 6-fold reduction in 501Y.V2, but titers remained above levels expected to be protective [Moderna website](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-retains-neutralizing-activity-against)
- 20H/501Y.V2 is reported to have resistance to monoclonal antibodies and convalescent plasma, with one study finding 93% of 44 plasma samples showed a reduction in titer and 48% had no detectable neutralization activity ([Wibmer et al., bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.18.427166v1)). A further study also detected reduction in neutralization by convalescent plasma ([Cele et al., medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.26.21250224v1)).
- 501Y.V2 has larger reduction to both mAbs and convalescent sera than 501Y.V1 ([Wang et al., bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.25.428137v2))
